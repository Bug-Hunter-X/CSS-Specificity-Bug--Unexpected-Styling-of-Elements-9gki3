The following CSS code snippet intends to style a button, but it unexpectedly affects other elements on the page due to a lack of specificity:

```css
button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

This is because the selector `button` is not specific enough; if another element has a similar styling, it will override the button styling, or vice versa.  The problem becomes amplified with nested selectors or when dealing with a complex stylesheet.
