The solution is to increase the specificity of the selector by adding an ID or a more specific class:

```css
#myButton {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

/* Or using a more specific class: */
.specialButton {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

This ensures that the styles are applied only to the intended element, resolving the conflict.  Always use more specific selectors whenever possible to maintain the expected styling and avoid unexpected side effects.
